I am Keana Bautista, a second year student taking up Electronics Engineering in University of Santo Tomas.
I grew up in Doha, Qatar with my family of five. I enjoy arts and crafts, thrilling rides, and spontaneous trips.
My dream is to work in the field of television broadcasting and pursue a Master's Degree after having a work experience.
